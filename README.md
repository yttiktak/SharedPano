# SharedPano
Panorama VR from Garden Gnome software makes a panorama into a VR experience. One can construct a network of leap points
to other points of view, other panoramas, BUT Only within your own VR world. 

I extend the GG software a bit to allow links to outside panos, other person's VR. 
This also requires a 'proxy' setup, to allow the outside VR media (images) into my local client. A bit messy, but there it is.
Messy, and not terribly polite, as I bypass the outsider's viewer for the most part, and simply access their data.

The outsider's link file has a return link appended to it when loaded into the local viewer, so the viewer can navigate back to where they came from.
