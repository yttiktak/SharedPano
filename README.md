# SharedPano
Panorama VR from Garden Gnome software makes a panorama into a VR experience. One can construct a network of leap points
to other points of view, other panoramas. BUT. Only within your own VR world. 
I extend the GG software a bit to allow links to outside panos, other person's VR. This also requires a 'proxy' setup, to 
allow the outside VR media (images) into my local client. A bit messy, but there it is.
The outsider's link file also has a return link appended to it, so the viewer can navigate back to where they came from.
